    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
      <li>nonstick cooking spray with flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl
        until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat butter, 1 cup white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an
        electric mixer until creamy, at least 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then mix in vanilla.</li>
      <li>
        Gradually mix in dry ingredients until well combined. Add oats and mix
        until thoroughly incorporated. Cover the bowl and chill dough in the
        refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        Spray two cookie sheets with floured cooking spray. Place water in a
        small bowl and 2 tablespoons sugar in another small bowl. Roll chilled
        dough into walnut-sized balls, and place 2 inches apart on the prepared
        cookie sheets. Dip a large fork in water, then in sugar, and use to
        flatten each cookie, re-wetting and re-sugaring as necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown around the edges and
        centers are nearly set, 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway
        through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring
        to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
